# Lost Hiker

Youâ€™re stationed at mission control, coordinating a Search & Rescue operation in a remote wilderness area.
A solo hiker activated their emergency beacon earlier today - but contact was lost shortly after.

A sweep of regional radio channels was recorded in an attempt to catch any outgoing transmissions. The result is a 30-second audio recording of selected radio frequencies.

Find and and decode the hikers message.
