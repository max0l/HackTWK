# Private detective

You were sitting in your detective agency when you got called by a customer. They want to send "a little gift" to their friend!
Must be their birthday soon! However they dont know in which city he lives. You have been given the following name:

Artem Olegovich 

You were a bit suspicious of the anonymous caller. So to proove that they are really good friends he sent you the passport of Artem. The scan
was really bad and you could only figure out the first four digits of the passport number.
